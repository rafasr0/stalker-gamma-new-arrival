"A hardcore roleplay start mod for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. GAMMA."

"You aren't a soldier. You aren't a mercenary. You are just a civilian who slipped through the perimeter under the cover of darkness, praying the military patrols wouldn't spot you. You came in search of riches and a fresh start—now you just have to survive. Do you have what it takes to become a legend in the zone?"

This mod creates a hardcore roleplay starting scenario for players who want a true "Zero to Hero" experience.
It strips away the safety net of the standard loadouts and gives you the bare minimum.

Key Features:
- Civilian Loadout: You start with nothing but a knife, a flashlight, the clothes on your back, and basic supplies. No guns, no military gear—only items easily available outside the Zone.
- Blind Start (No PDA): You spawn without a PDA. You cannot see the map, tasks, or messages until you scavenge enough money to buy one.
- Pocket Change: You start with only 500 Rubles—barely enough for a loaf of bread, let alone gear.
- Terrifying Night: You hopped the fence while the military patrols were changing shifts. The game forces a 23:00 (11 PM) start time.


Roleplay Spawns:
- Loners: Locked to Rookie Village. You're a civilian, leaving your past behind to seek a new life in the Zone.
- Bandits: Locked to Dark Valley. You are a fugitive fleeing the law. Smuggled into the Zone by a criminal contact, you must now work for Sultan to pay off your heavy debt.

All other faction starts are disabled to enforce the scenario and starting with them defaults to Loner start.

Installation:

1. Install as a standard mod in MO2.
2. Start a New Game -> Select Loner or Bandit.
