"You aren't a hero. You are a rookie, a disgrace, or a debtor. You have no map, no gun, and no reputation. Do you have what it takes to survive the climb?"

This mod creates a hardcore roleplay starting scenario for players who want a true "Zero to Hero" experience. But not as punishing as the Black Road start.
It strips away the safety net of the standard loadouts and gives you the bare minimum.

Key Features:
Zero to Hero Loadout: No matter who you join, you start with nothing but a knife, a flashlight, and the clothes on your back. No guns, no military gear. And barely any supplies for your first day.
Blind Start(No PDA): You spawn without a PDA. You cannot see the map, tasks, or messages until you scavenge enough money to buy one.
No Money, No Problem: Each faction now has a set amount of starting money.
Terrifying Night: The game forces a 23:00 (11 PM) start time.
Scripted Roleplay Objectives: A new script triggers a lore-friendly introduction and "Win Condition" message when you start.


Installation:

Install as a standard mod in MO2.
Start a New Game.

Hotfix v1.1:
Loadout Unification: Updated all other factions, beside Bandits, configurations to inherit the Loner loadout.

Update v2.0 - The Faction Update: Previous versions locked you to Loner/Bandit. Now, all factions are playable with their own unique "Zero to Hero" origins. Every faction now has a reason to start with nothing and a fluff win condition suggestion.
